        <p>Elements, tags, and attributes are basic concepts in HTML.</p>
        <p>
            HTML element is a main structural unit of a web page. HTML tags are used to define HTML elements, and
            attributes provide additional information about these elements.

            they only “instruct” browsers how to show the content of the web page
