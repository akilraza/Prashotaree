        <h4>Defining JavaScript</h4>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a scripting or a programming language, allowing developers to perform complex features on web
            pages. Initially, this language was created for making web pages alive. In JavaScript, the programs are
            called scripts. One can write them in the HTML of a web page, then it will automatically run once the page
            loads. At this point, JavaScript is completely different from another language, called Java.
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially, when JavaScript was created, it was called “LiveScript”. Then, as Java was extremely popular in
            that period, then it was decided to call it JavaScript to position it relative to Java. But, over the years,
            JavaScript has transformed into a completely independent language, with its specification, known as
            ECMAscript, having no relation to Java. Modern JavaScript can both work in the browser and on the server.
            Basically, it can run on any device that has a specific program known as the JavaScript engine.
        </p>
        <h4>What In-browser JavaScript Does</h4>
        <p>
            Modern JavaScript is considered a safe programming language. It never provides low-level access to the
            memory or CPU as it was made for the browsers that don’t require it. The capabilities of this language
            highly rely on the environment it runs in. For example, Node.js includes functions allowing JavaScript to
            write and read arbitrary files, implement network requests, and so on. In-browser JavaScript does anything
            related to web page manipulation.
        </p>
        <h6>For example, with in-browser JavaScript, you can do the following:</h6>
        <p>
            1: Adding new HTML to the page, changing the content, modifying the styles.
        </p>
        <p>
            2: Reacting to use actions, running on mouse clicks, key presses, and more
        </p>
        <p>
            3: Sending requests over the network to remote servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            4: Getting and setting cookies, asking questions to visitors, sending messages.
        </p>
        <p>
            5: Remembering the data on the client-side.
        </p>
        <h4>Limitations of In-browser JavaScript</h4>
        <p>
            The capabilities of JavaScript are limited for the purpose of keeping the user’s safety. With it, an evil
            web page can’t access private information or harm the user’s data.
        </p>
        <h6>Here are some examples of such restrictions:</h6>
        <p>
            1: JavaScript has no direct access to OS functions. It can’t read and write arbitrary files on the hard
            disc,
            copy or execute them.
        </p>
        <p>
            2: Different windows/tabs don’t recognize each other. JavaSCript from one page is not able to access the
            other
            one, in case they are from different sites. It’s known as “Same Origin Policy”.
        </p>
        <p>
            3: JavaScript allows communication over the net to the server from where the page comes from. But, its
            capability of receiving data from the other site is prohibited. That’s a safety limitation.
        </p>
        <h4>What Makes JavaScript Specific</h4>
        <h6>There are at least three perfect things about JavaScript:</h6>
        <p>
            1: It supports complete integration with CSS and HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
            2: It provides straightforward ways of doing simple things
        </p>
        <p> 3: It is supported by almost all the major browsers and is performed by default.</p>
        <p>
            It is the exclusive browser technology that encompasses the three great things above.
        </p>
        <p>
            In modern programming, JavaScript is the most widespread tool that helps to create browser interfaces. It
            also allows creating mobile applications, servers, and much more. Our JavaScript book consists of several
            sections that cover all the information you need to learn this unique programming language. Each of the
            chapters includes both the theory and practical cases to make it easier for beginners to grasp the language.
        </p>
        <h2>JavaScript Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>What is JavaScript?</h4>
        <p>
            JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, lightweight, interpreted computer programming language. It’s designed
            for creating network-centric apps. It has made modern web apps possible— apps with which you can interact
            directly without doing a page reload for every action. It’s also used in more traditional websites to
            provide different forms of interactivity and cleverness.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript is mostly used as a part of web pages. Implementations of JavaScript allow client-side script to
            interact with the user and make dynamic web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s a programming language with object-oriented capabilities. It’s a very strong client-side scripting
            language. JavaScript is an untyped interpreted programming language that is well-suited to object-oriented
            and functional programming styles. This programming language will help to make your webpage livelier and
            more interactive.
        </p>
        <h6>Things that make JavaScript great and unique:</h6>
        <p>
            1: Full integration with HTML/CSS
        </p>
        <p>
            2: Simple things are done simply
        </p>
        <p>
            3: All major browsers support and enabled by default
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript is the only browser technology that includes these three points. Now you understand why it’s the
            most widespread and powerful tool for creating browser interfaces. JavaScript helps to create servers,
            mobile applications, games, etcF
        </p>
        <h4>Why is it called JavaScript?</h4>
        <p>
            JavaScript programming language was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995. When JavaScript was created it was
            known as LiveScript. Netscape changed its name to JavaScriptJavaScript programming language was developed by
            Brendan Eich in 1995. When JavaScript was created it was known as LiveScript. Netscape changed its name to
            JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            Important to know that JavaScript has almost nothing to do with the programming language called Java. The
            JavaScript name was inspired by marketing considerations. The Java programming language was being heavily
            marketed and popular when JavaScript was being introduced. After it was adopted outside of Netscape, a
            standard document was written to describe how the JavaScript language should work. JavaScript has a long way
            since it becomes a robust, powerful and efficient general-purpose language.
        </p>
        <h4>Why to use JavaScript? </h4>
        <p>
            Today, JavaScript is one of the most powerful, popular, and flexible programming languages. It provides
            dynamic behavior on most websites. JavaScript is used by the overwhelming majority of modern websites.
            JavaScript interpreters are included in all modern web browsers—on desktops, game consoles, tablets, and
            smartphones. This makes JavaScript the most ubiquitous programming language in history. JavaScript is a
            programming language that all Web developers should learn. HTML is needed to specify the content of web
            pages, CSS to specify the presentation of web pages, and JavaScript to specify the behavior of web pages.
        </p>
        <h6>JavaScript has a lot of advantages like:</h6>
        <p>
            1: Less server interaction
        </p>
        <p>
            2: Immediate feedback to the visitors
        </p>
        <p>
            3: Increased interactivity
        </p>
        <p>
            4: Richer interfaces
        </p>
        <h2>Start using Javascript</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>Writing Your First JavaScript Program</h4>
        <p>
            HTML can’t do the math, it can’t figure out if someone has correctly filled out a form. HTML just let people
            read the text, watch videos, look at pictures, and click links. You need JavaScript to add intelligence to
            your web pages so they can respond to your site’s visitors. So JavaScript lets you make your websites more
            attractive, effective, and useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            JavaScript is more complex than HTML or CSS, the main goal of this book is to help you think more like a
            programmer. JavaScript program has this kind of symbols ({ } [ ] ; , () !=) and many unfamiliar words (var,
            null, else if). We can say, that learning a programming language is a lot like learning another language.
            You need to learn new words and understand how to put them together.
        </p>
        <h4>About Computer Program?</h4>
        <p>
            Adding JavaScript to a web page means that you're writing a computer program. Many JavaScript programs are
            much simpler than the programs you use to read email, build web pages. But even though JavaScript programs,
            which also scripts are simpler and shorter and share many of the same properties of more complicated
            programs.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to display a welcome message using the web-page visitor’s name: “Welcome, John Doe!”, you need
            to do several things:
        </p>
        <p>
            1: Ask the name of the visitor.
        </p>
        <p>
            2:Get the visitor’s reply
        </p>
        <p>
            3:Print the message on the web page.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you want to create a JavaScript program, you must determine the steps needed to achieve your goal.
            After knowing the steps, you’ll translate your ideas into programming code - the words and characters that
            make the web browser behave the way you want it to.
