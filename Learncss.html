            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language designed to format the layout of Web pages. It is
            used to enable the separation of presentation and content, which includes layout, colors, and fonts.
            They improve the accessibility of content, make it more flexible. CSS enables the specific look of HTML in
            the browser. CSS has lots of advantages.
            CSS is a great time-saver; you can write CSS once and then use the same sheet in multiple HTML pages. It
            provides multiple device compatibility; style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of
            device.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our CSS tutorial, you will learn how to use CSS to control the style and layout of multiple Web pages all
            at once.
            CSS was introduced together with HTML to provide a better way to style HTML elements.
        </p>
        <h4>CSS Basics</h4>
        <P>
            In CSS Basics Chapter, you will get familiar with the Usage of CSS, that is the way to add styles to the
            HTML document and the right way of writing the syntax. Also, you will get the recap of CSS Texts, Font,
            Links, Tables, Border, Padding, and Margin. Each of these pages represents the set of properties and their
            values that will be discussed in detail in the next chapters. CSS Basics Chapter also presents CSS Gradients
            that display progressive transitions between two or more specified colors making the backgrounds more
            beautiful and unique.
        </P>
        <h4>CSS Guides</h4>
        <p>
            Our CSS Book provides a long and detailed Flexbox Guide, which will help you learn and understand the
            concept of the single-dimensional layout with examples. In this chapter, we suggest a list of all CSS3
            Properties divided into categories with their short descriptions.
        </p>
        <h4>Selectors</h4>
        <p>
            CSS is a rule-based language, which means that you define rules specifying groups of styles applying to
            particular elements or groups of elements on the web page. CSS Selectors are part of a CSS rule set used for
            selecting the content you want to style. CSS selectors select HTML elements according to their id, class,
            type, attribute, etc. In the Selector Chapter, we represent the pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements with
            their examples and browser supports. You will even get information about those selectors which are not
            frequently used.
        </p>
        <h4>Properties</h4>
        <p>
            The CSS Properties Chapter covers almost 250 properties with both the most used and deprecated ones, which
            are used to style the HTML elements. Each property page provides lots of examples that you can try yourself.
            Read important tips and notes to make the right choice.

        <h2>CSS Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a
            document written in a markup language.
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS was developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS defines how the HTML elements are to be displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Styles are normally saved in external .css files. External style sheets allow you to change the appearance
            and layout of all the pages in a Website, just by editing one single file.
        </p>
        <h4>CSS Usage</h4>
        <p>
            There are 3 ways to add CSS styles to the HTML document.
        </p>
        <p>
            1. Inline style - giving a style attribute to HTML elements
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Internal style - using the (style) element in the (head) section
        </p>
        <p>
            3. External style - creating an external CSS file
        </p>
        <h4>Inline Style</h4>
        <p>
            For defining style rules, you can use a style attribute of any HTML element . You can apply these rules only
            to that element.
            The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
        </p>
        <h4>Internal Style</h4>
        <p>
            With internal style, each HTML file contains the CSS code needed for styling a page. You simply put the CSS
            code within the

            (head) (/head) tags of each HTML file you want to style. The example below illustrates this.
        </p>
        <p>
            The changes you make will affect only one page. If you need to style more pages, you should make changes to
            them one by one.
        </p>
        <h4>CSS Version</h4>
        <table class="table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Version</th>
                    <th>Year</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>CSS 1</td>
                    <td>1996</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>CSS 2</td>
                    <td>1998</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>CSS 3</td>
                    <td>1999</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <h4>CSS Syntax</h4>
        <p>
            CSS syntax consists of 3 parts: a selector, a property and a value
        </p>
        <p>
            The selector is an HTML element which you want to style. This could be any tag like
            (h1), (p) etc. Each selector can have one and more properties.
        </p>
        <p>
            The property is the style attribute of an HTML tag. All HTML attributes are converted into CSS properties
            (color, border, etc.). Each property has its value.
        </p>
        <p>
            The value is assigned to property. For example, the value of the color property can be either red or #F1F1F1
        </p>
        <h4>CSS Comments</h4>
        <p>
            You can use CSS comments to add explanations to the code. They are not displayed because browsers ignore
            them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The beginning and the end of a CSS comment is specified by "/*" and "*/", respectively:
        </p>
    </div>
